# 🎓 Student Performance Predictor

A machine learning web application that predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on academic scores and demographic information. The model is trained on real-world data and deployed using Flask, with an intuitive web interface.

## 📌 Overview

This project uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on student performance data, including math, reading, and writing scores, as well as gender, parental education level, and test preparation status. It includes a web interface for user input and real-time prediction results.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts pass/fail outcome from student performance data.
- Interactive web form with real-time results.
- Clean and responsive interface using Bootstrap.
- Model saved using Joblib for reuse.
- Local deployment with Flask.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Details

The model is a RandomForestClassifier trained on a dataset of student performance. It calculates the average of the three exam scores and labels students as 'pass' or 'fail' based on a defined threshold. The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 99.5%.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data processing
- Scikit-learn for model training
- Flask for web app
- HTML5/CSS with Bootstrap for UI
- Joblib for saving and loading the model
